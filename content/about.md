I'm a software developer with 6+n years of experience using various languages including C#, TypeScript and PowerShell to create high-quality solutions. I like to employ [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) and [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) to best achieve this.

While software is my fort√©, I enjoy getting involved with infrastructure and I've administered both Windows and Linux servers. To me, installing software on servers to provide a useful service is all part of it!

My latest focus has been employing microservice architecture patterns to achieve scalability, as well as using benchmarks and load tests to guide optimisations.

I revel working in teams, helping peers take their work to the next level and learning everything I can from the knowledgeable individuals around me.
